            <h1>Biofloc Aquaculture</h1>
            <h2>Cheaper Fish Farming Technology</h2>
            <p>Biofloc is an innovative and cost-effective technology in which toxic materials to the fish and shellfish such as Nitrate, Nitrite, Ammonia can be converted to useful product. This technology is used in aquaculture system with limited or zero water exchange under high stocking density, strong aeration and biota formed by biofloc.</p>
